Project developed during the course of Solidity and smart contracts in Ethereum


This project was developed during the course Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide by Sthephen Grider. 

The following technologies were used in this project: 

- React.JS (front-end) 
- Next.JS (dynamical routing) 
- Solidity (high-level language for implementing smart-contract) 

All contracts and transactions were performed on the Ethereum's test network called "Rinkeby".
